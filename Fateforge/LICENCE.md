# FATEFORGE Visuals Terms of Use (VTU v1.0 license)

The Agate Studio team has always encouraged the creativity of the community. The VTU license for Fateforge aims to give the community several tools to bring the world of Eana to life by creating their own game aids and scenarios. This project includes the provision of visuals from the Fateforge range, collected in Graphic Kits. Their use can only be made on the condition that users respect a certain number of rules. These rules are gathered in the present license. The license also gives the community certain rights to use the official contents of the Fateforge range.
The license applies only to content published in the Fateforge Graphics Kits.
Any use of other content must receive written permission from the publisher.
The studio reserves the right to change, correct and supplement these terms. The latest version available online is the current one.
